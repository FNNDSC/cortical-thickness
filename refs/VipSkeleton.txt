VipSkeleton

------------------------------
VIP Info:
	 Compute a 3D skeleton of the object (usually dedicated to cortical folds)
------------------------------
Default modes are dedicated to the cortex (input comes from VipHomotopicSnake)
In that case, a voronoi related to sulcal root is also proposed.

Usage: VipSkeleton
        -i[nput] {image name} : object definition
        [-so[utput] {image name (default:"skeleton")}]
        [-vo[utput] {image name (default:"rootsvoronoi")}]
        [-sk[eleton] {w/s/0  (default:w)}]
w: the skeletonization is coupled with the watershed idea
   this mode is dedicated to the cortical fold extraction
   this mode requires an image to compute its mean curvature as a ridge detector
   The aim is an homotopic skeleton following the ridges
s: standard homotopic skeletomization
0: no skeletonization
        [-im[mortality] {string:a/s/c/n (default:s)}]
property required to be preserved during the homotopic skeletonization
a: homotopic with full preservation of points, curves and surfaces
s: homotopic with full preservation of points and surfaces
c: homotopic with full preservation of points and curves
n: homotopic with no preservation
        [-fv[oronoi] {y/n  (default:y)}]
Computes a voronoi of the input object corresponding to a sulcal root based parcellisation
this mode requires an image to compute its Gaussian curvature as a saddle point detector
This saddle points represent the anatomical plis de passage
        [-p[rune] {string:c/o/co/0 (default:co)}]
c: homotopic pruning of curves
o: homotopic pruning of outside 6-neighbors
co: c & o
0: no pruning
        [-wp[rune] {int:minimum catchment bassin depth (default:3mm)}]
        [-li[nside] {int:label<290 (default:0)}]
        [-lo[utside] {int:label<290 (default:11)}]
        [-c[lassification] {y/n (default:y)}]
this flag trigered a final topological classification of the skeleton
        [-g[eometry] {image name (default:nothing)}]
--------------------------Mean curvature:-----------------------------------------
with watershed flag trigered, the watershed idea is related to the isophote mean
curvature of this image, which is usually a MR image with segmented brain
but could be the input binary image or a distance map computed from it
In this context, mean curvature is used as a ridge detector
During the first iterations, points whose mc < mcthreshold can not become immortals
This trick helps the skeletonization to get rid of small non significative simple surfaces
The skeletonization itself follows an immersion like process begining above mcthreshold
--------------------------Gaussian curvature:-----------------------------------------
with voronoi flag trigered, this image is used to compute isophote Gaussian curvature
Then points of the gray/white interface whose gc<gcthreshold are marked
The cortical folds are filled in at this location to reduce depth
        [-lz[ero] {(float) lowest mean curvature for watershed (default:0.3)}]
        [-lu[p] {(float) highest mean curvature for watershed(default:1)}]
        [-e[rosion] {(float) wave erosion for watershed (default:0.1)}]
        [-readmc {mean_curvature image name (default:nothing)}]
        [-mcs[igma] {float (mm)  (default:1mm)}]
the sigma of the Gaussian smoothing before mean curvature computation
        [-gcs[igma] {float (mm)  (default:2mm)}]
the sigma of the Gaussian smoothing before Gaussian curvature computation
        [-mct[hreshold] {float (default:0.2)}]
        [-gct[hreshold] {float (default:-0.05)}]

        [-ve[rsion] {int, version depending on the hemi_cortex version, 1 or 2 (default: 2)}]
        [-r[eadformat] {char: v or t (default:v)}]
        [-w[riteformat] {char: v or t (default:v)}]
       [-srand {int (default: time}]
Initialization of the random seed, useful to get reproducible results
